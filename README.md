# 🧑‍💻 Jose Bautista - Developer Portfolio (V3)

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio site! This project showcases who I am, what I build, and how to get in touch — all wrapped in a mobile-friendly, React-based interface.

Deployed: [https://josebautista.biz](https://josebautista.biz)

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Navbar** with hamburger menu and modal-based navigation
- **Smooth Scroll One-Page Layout** with sections: Home, About, Projects, Resume, Contact
- **Resume Modal** with embedded PDF preview (desktop) or direct link (mobile)
- **Projects Carousel** using `Swiper.js` for interactive showcasing
- **About Section** with career highlights, education, and certifications
- **Contact Modal** for clean communication options (LinkedIn, GitHub, email)

---

## 📁 Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** for blazing-fast frontend performance
- **CSS Modules + Media Queries** for custom styling and mobile responsiveness
- **Swiper.js** for the interactive project carousel
- **Modals** built from scratch using React state and conditional rendering
- **Hosted on Vercel** with custom domain at [josebautista.biz](https://josebautista.biz)

## 🧠 Learnings & Notes

- Embedded PDFs don’t scroll on iOS — used conditional rendering to fix UX
- Mobile download behavior is limited, so resume links open in new tab instead
- Emphasis on clean structure and modern UI/UX principles
