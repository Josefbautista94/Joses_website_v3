          Hello! I'm <strong>Jose Bautista</strong>, a software engineer with
          a <strong>B.S. in Computer Science</strong> from <strong>Lehman College</strong>. I'm passionate about
          technology, creativity, and continuous growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          I recently completed the <strong>Software Engineering</strong> program at
          <strong> Per Scholas </strong> (May 2025), where I focused on full-stack
          development using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and
          Node.js.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along the way, I’ve been diving into Agile/Scrum, advanced
          JavaScript, TypeScript, CI/CD workflows, and state management with Redux.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm always open to collaborating on web development
          projects, especially those that push the limits of JavaScript and
          backend logic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of code, I’m into fitness, anime, tech discussions, and
          mixology. Fun fact: I’m a licensed bartender who enjoys crafting
          creative cocktails with precision.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're looking to collaborate, mentor, or just connect — feel free to reach out.
